# dayinthelife.dev Coming Soon Page

This is the code for the Coming Soon page for [dayinthelife.dev](dayinthelife.dev). dayinthelife.dev is a project I'm working on that will serve as a platform for techies of all disciplines to talk about what their daily routine in their role is like. I want this project to be a resource for beginners, early career devs, and career switchers.

This coming soon page was made with HTML and CSS. Eventually, the blog platform will be built using Eleventy. There are some errors or non-best practices being practiced in this code. But this is more about shipping this coming soon page. This will all be replaced really soon.

If you're interested in being involved in the project, please feel free to reach out to me [via Twitter dm](https://twitter.com/ceeoreo_)! Thanks!
